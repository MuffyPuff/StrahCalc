function file definition format

exports "name"; // call function with name
// name2 has no export so no shorthand like "name2"

function name(){}; // actual internal name is "_folder_file_name"
function name2(){}; // actual internal name is "_folder_file_name2"

/**
 * name conflicts should be resolved by:
 *  1. adding a namespace
 *       "_folder_file1_name" --> "file1_name"
 *       "_folder_file2_name" --> "file2_name"
 *       "_folder1_file_name" --> "folder1_file_name"
 *       "_folder2_file_name" --> "folder2_file_name"
 *  2. error because function redefined in same file
 *       will look into overloading
